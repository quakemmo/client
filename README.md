ABOUT
=====
Quake MMO is an attempt of adding MMO-like features to Quake3.

The original Ioquake3 README.md has been moved to README-ioq3.md.


CODING STYLE
============
Legacy code retains whatever style it has.

New code:
Indentation is TABS, each TAB = 4 spaces.
As a rule of thumb, readability is more important than performance unless
150 FPS is being threatened.

Generally speaking K&R / Linux kernel C coding style applies, with the following quirks:
	- Line length can go up to 125 chars if it seems like a good idea
	- Functions have the opening brace on the same line as the function name
	- Typedefs are a good thing
